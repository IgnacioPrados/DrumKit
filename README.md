## Description
Several years ago I was playing drums, but I decided to sell it, buy myself a computer, and start programming. I do not regret it since now I can play digitally with this website.

## Details
Yes, the mini story I just told you is real, I played drums for 3 years, but I found that programming appealed to me more. Still, I still love music, and that's why I decided to create this website.
<br><br>
It allows you to play both by clicking on the images and with the keyboard, using the indicated keys. I did this thanks to the DOM keyboard methods.

## Key Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
